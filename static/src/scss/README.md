All styles are modularized in the directory

```
/partials/
```

We will have all the SCSS modularized, with variables that we define in /vars.sccs and then include in an SCSS (example style.scss).
With gulp we automate the process of converting it to CSS and minifying it in the folder.

```
/static/dist/css/
```
